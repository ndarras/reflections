How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

I can easyly track changes and revert to older versions safely.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

The version stored are working versions and have a functional difference which makes more sence when checked later.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

By using th commit id I can compare any version and find the differences between the files.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

By starting a branch version I am confident that the master version will not be broken after the testing.
